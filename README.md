Abstract 

    The Automatic security system is a alarm device which rings the alarm and sends alert message to phone when the door is  opened by a person. The on/off switch is connected with the security system to enable this feature. The purpose of building this system is to prevent the loss of property due to theft that we face in our daily lives. This system includes Esp8266 NodeMCU microcontroller, ultrasonic sensor, buzzer, voltage regulator, power supply and Blynk application. When the door opening is detected, it turns on the buzzer, and then sends alert message to phone. We can easily fix it on the door and turn on when everyone gets out of the room.

Tools Used :
    Esp8266 Nodemcu Microcontroller
    Ultrasonic Sensor
    Buzzer
    Regulator
    Switch
    Connecting wires
    Blynk  Application
    Arduino IDE
